# Simple Stream

Low latency point-to-point game streamer & player; best suited for 8-bit
computer emulators. Can also capture locally and record streams.

## What it do?

Simple Stream uses `ffmpeg` to stream a window as low latency MPEG2-TS
(H.246/AAC) via either TCP or UDP. Audio is sourced from all desktop audio
(excluding microphones) or just the audio of emulators Simple Stream is aware
of.

The TCP/UDP streams created are intended for a remote observer to watch or be
included in an [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) scene via Media Source.

Video can be encoded using `libx264`, `h264_nvenc` and `h264_vaapi`. `libx264`
and `h264_nvenc` are recommended as they are both tuned for low latency.

Simple Stream is currently *"aware"* of the following emulators, which means it
knows how to crop out menus and status areas to optimise the stream and also how
to automatically route just their audio.

  * [Caprice32 - Amstrad CPC Emulator](https://github.com/ColinPitrat/caprice32)
  * [Fuse - the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/)
  * [VICE - the Versatile Commodore Emulator](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/)

In order to stream point-to-point the receiving party must configure NAT on
their router to allow the appropriate port (4864 by default) to be allowed
through. When streaming via TCP (the default), `play-stream.sh` must be started
by the receiving party before the streamer starts `stream.sh`.

### Example

Fred wants to stream game play to his friend Barny.

#### Barny

  1. Barny configures NAT on his router to accept TCP/UDP on port 4864 and route that to his PC.
  2. Barny runs `./play-stream.sh -ip 24.65.43.257`, where 24.65.43.257 is his routers Internet facing IP address.
  3. Barny tells Fred he is ready to receive and his IP address.

#### Fred

  1. Fred runs `./stream.sh -ip 24.65.43.257`
  2. When prompted Fred clicks on the window of the game he wants to stream.
  3. Fred is now streaming to Barny.

#### Barny

  1. Barny will see a window of Fred's game appear.
  2. When Barny closes the stream it will automatically disconnect Fred's stream.

# Requirements

Simple Stream is a shell script that uses the following awesome software.

  - `coreutils`
  - `grep`
  - `ffmpeg` (snap preferred since it enables h264_nvenc and h264_vaapi)
  - `nvidia-settings` (optional; required for reliable capture when using nvidia drivers)
  - `nvidia-utils-xyx` (optional; required for h264_nvenc)
  - `mpv` (optional)
  - `pulseaudio-utils`
  - `scrot`
  - `sed`
  - `vainfo` (optional; required for h264_vaapi)
  - `x11-utils`

## Install

### Ubuntu 18.04 or newer

Run `install.sh` included in this repository.

# Documentation

The scripts in Simple Stream try and do the right thing by default, but if you
need to tweak their behaviour this is how to do it.

## Video streaming and local capture

  * `stream.sh` - Streams the selected window and loopback audio (MPEG2-TS).
  * `capture.sh` - Captures the selected window and loopback audio (Matroska).

```
Usage
  stream [--ffmpeg /snap/bin/ffmpeg] [--fps 60] [--ip 192.168.0.1]
              [--mouse] [--port 4864] [--protocol tcp|udp]

              [--vbitrate 640k] [--vcodec libx264] [--vsync] [--help]

You can also pass optional parameters
  --ffmpeg        : Set the full path to ffmpeg.
  --fps           : Set framerate to stream at.
  --ip            : Set the IP address to stream to.
  --mouse         : Enable capture of mouse cursor; disabled by default.
  --port          : Set the tcp/udp port to stream to.
  --protocol      : Set the protocol to stream over. [tcp|udp]
  --steam-options : Set tcp/udp stream options; such as '?fifo_size=10240'.
  --vaapi-device  : Set the full path to the VA-API device; such as /dev/dri/renderD128
  --vbitrate      : Set video codec bitrate for the stream.
  --vcodec        : Set video codec for the stream. [libx264|h264_nvenc|h264_vaapi]
  --vsync         : Enable vsync in the video encoder; disabled by default.
  --help          : This help.
```

## Video player and recorder

  * `play-stream.sh` - Plays a UDP or TCP stream using `ffplay` or `mpv`.
  * `record-stream.sh` - Records a UDP or TCP stream used `ffmpeg`.

```
